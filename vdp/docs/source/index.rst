The VLITE Database Pipeline, or **vdp**, is a collection of
Python scripts to automate the measurement and database
archiving of radio astronomical point sources detected in
VLITE images.

This documentation provides a high level overview of how
to run and use the **vdp**, as well as detailed descriptions
of each stage in the pipeline.
